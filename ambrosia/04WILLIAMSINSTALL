Installing this at Williams.

First, everything must be installed through eringer in the subdirectory
structure
  /usr/imacs/intel/mac-cs-local/...
which corresponds to 
  /usr/mac-cs-local/...
on laboratory macintoshes.

The system depends on the ambrosia tree being installed at
   mac-cs-local/share/cs109/python/ambrosia/...
In particular, the ambrosia/scripts directory must be reachable
by the python system in order for the workflow to function.

You can do this, directly, using svn, to check out ambrosia
into the python directory, making sure your umask is 0002 (only
disallowing o+w).

You must then move
   mac-cs-local/share/cs109/python/ambrosia/scripts/109
to 
   mac-cs-local/bin/109
which allows students to
   source 109
which, in turn, allows Python access to the python version of the
structures library (not directly needed by ambrosia), as well as the
ambrosia code.
