Ambrosia is the a simple, academic modeling system built atop the Python
programming language.  In a typical Ambrosia session, the modeler describes
a scene, positions lights and cameras, and uses the cameras to take pictures
or render images.  Ambrosia has simple facilities for rendering movies, as
well.

This wiki provides a number of pages of documentation that describe 
the features of Ambrosia.  Most documentation is supported with examples
that demonstrate typical usage.
