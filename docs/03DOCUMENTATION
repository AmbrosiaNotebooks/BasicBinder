DOCUMENTATION EXPECTATIONS

In order to be as useful as possible, it is important that we provide
high quality documentation that allows students to explore, experiment,
understand, and abstract the basic functionality of the system.

Important to this are:
 0. Installation and distribution details.
 1. Significant Python-native documenation of all features.
    Carefully written docstrings for modules, classes, and methods.
    All constants and global variables included in module documentation.
 2. A brief, solid, language reference page, linking to simple examples.
    The motivation for this is the success of the Processing language
    reference pages.
 3. A deep set of examples.
    A series of examples that push the student to a deeper understanding of
    how increasingly complex modeling features and programming paradigms might
    be used to model scenes.
 4. A broad set of problems.
    Included, here, are laboratory exercises, in a standard format, that might
    be used to exercise student understanding as the semester progresses.
    The ideal would be 3-4 labs choices for each of 10 lab meetings.  For
    schools with semesters, this might correspond to their normal lab schedule.
    For quarter or summer programs, this might provide the basis for a more
    intensive laboratory experience.
[5. Lectures.
    A model series of lecture outlines that might help to bootstrap a
    college-level or AP course at a new institution.]
