* Add a left-handed/right-handed switch.
  Can the use of such a switch be isolated to the basic linear algebra section?

* It would be nice if lights, like cameras, could be repositioned under xform

* Shadowless spot lights seem not to work.

* Check that all attribute functions return some value: either self, or
  the value they're retrieving.

* Push the selection predicates into one place.  Perhaps context?

* POV object is accessed independently of environment (see lights, for example)
  Is this what we want?

* Unify shapes of values.
  The COI and pos primitives take a 3-vector.
  The normal (of the Plane class), or dimensions (of the Cube class) take
  3 values.
  Which is better?

* Should we change the messages that are used with CSG grouping constructs:
  Groups:
   add,add,add
  Intersection:
   add,add,add??
  Difference:
   add,remove,remove,...??

* Make sure no POV methods are visible externally.

* Should extrude and sweep be lifted to an object status?
  They would be a mesh-like object, but only add profile, or add tranform.

  lamp = Sweep().profile(p).steps(3)

  worm = Extrude().front(p).extrudeWith(translate(0,0,-100))
  worm = Extrude().front(p).extrudeTo(backp)

  Both could have caps/nocaps.
