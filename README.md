This is a repository for an on-line course on the Ambrosia modeling system.  This Python-based language was developed at Williams College to support their course in Computer Science, *The Art & Science of Computer Graphics*.

Here, you will find many of the course materials, developed specifically for use with Jupyter Notebooks.  You may look at and modify the course materials by pressing the button above, even if you don't have local processing hardware.
